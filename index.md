Welcome to the Critical CS Education resource site! We're a researcher-practitioner partnership at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu), [Shoreline School District](https://www.shorelineschools.org), and [Highline School District](http://highlineschools.org) investigating innovative ways to integrate CS education and social justice. As part of this partnership, we've created this site to help current and aspiring CS educators bring critical perspectives into their CS teaching. Our work particularly focuses on secondary and post-secondary perspectives, but the resources on this site can be useful in any learning context.

The primary resources on this site include:

* A forthcoming [book](book/) that teaches the foundations of computing with a critical lens, and offers example unit plans for teaching these foundations in middle and high school settings.

* Information about [STEP CS](program/), our new secondary CS teacher education endorsement at the [University of Washington](http://uw.edu) [College of Education](http://education.uw.edu).
