---

We are a researcher-practitioner partnership at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu), [Shoreline School District](https://www.shorelineschools.org), and [Highline School District](http://highlineschools.org) investigating innovative ways to integrate CS education and social justice. Our team combines diverse perspectives and expertise in secondary teacher education, CS education research, administration, and social justice perspectives on computing and society. Our goal is to prepare a new generation of secondary CS educators who center social justice in their teaching, developing students critical consciousness about their relationship to computing in the world.

Our core activities include:

* Writing a [free, online, web accessible book](book/), which will be posted on this website, presenting justice-framings of CS foundations and methods for teaching those foundations.
* A new 5th quarter add-on endorsement in the UW College of Education's Secondary Teacher Education Program, graduating up to 20 new secondary CS teachers a year to serve Washington state schools. We're calling this [STEP CS](/program).
* A series of studies about the tensions and opportunities in preparing justice-focused CS educators.
* Fostering a community of justice-focused CS educators across Washington state, to support professional learning, networking.

Throughout these activities, our goal is to broaden participation in CS by diversifying CS teachers, and preparing them to teach in CS culturally-responsive, critically conscious ways.
