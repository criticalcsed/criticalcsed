Computing has transformed society in magical ways, while at the same time amplifying inequality, inequity, and systems of oppression. How do we teach Computer Science in a way that helps youth harness its power, while also recognizing its capacity for harm?

Our researcher-practitioner partnership is trying to answer this question. Centered at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu), and in partnership with [Shoreline School District](https://www.shorelineschools.org) and [Highline School District](http://highlineschools.org), we're investigating innovative ways to integrate CS education and social justice. (See more about [our team](about/)).

This website is where we share our findings, as well as other resources we've curated from across the world. Our work particularly focuses on secondary and post-secondary settings, but the resources on this site might be useful in any learning context.

The primary resources on this site include:

* Our book, [Critically Conscious Computing: Methods for Secondary Education](book/), which teaches the foundations of computing with a critical lens, and offers example unit plans for teaching these foundations in middle and high school settings.

* Information about [STEP CS](program/), our new secondary CS teacher education endorsement at the [University of Washington](http://uw.edu) [College of Education](http://education.uw.edu).

* Access to [communities of CS teachers](communities/).

* A curated collection of [resources on critical CS pedagogy](resources/).

In addition to the above, we plan to add sections with links to teaching materials, curricula, recommended readings, and communities of other CS educators.
