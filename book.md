Throughout 2021, we're writing a book to support secondary CS teacher education, tentatively titled _Critically Conscious Computing: Methods for Secondary Education_. While there are many books that concern CS teaching, this book will be unique in its focus on critical pedagogy. It will teach foundational ideas in Computer Science, but through a social justice lens, and then offer several teaching methods for teaching these foundations ways that raise students' critical conscious.

We expect to release the book here, online, for free, by Autumn 2021.
