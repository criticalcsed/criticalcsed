We're curating a list of resources for critical CS pedagogy below. Do you have a resource you'd like to add? Send them to <a href="mailto:ajko@uw.edu">Amy</a> for inclusion!

# Practice Briefs

We've been developing short 2-page practice briefs that help teachers and school leaders understand opportunities for teaching CS in more critically conscious ways:

* [How to Teach Computer Science as Both a Technical and Social Subject](/assets/documents/TeachingCSTechnicallyAndSocially.pdf) offers opportunities for linking CS to topics in social sciences.

* [Talking about Artificial Intelligence](assets/documents/TalkingAboutArtificialIntelligence.pdf) explains basic concepts in AI and equity, identifying ways to address these concepts in classrooms.

The Mozilla Foundation has also compiled several short practice briefs:

* [Teaching Responsible Computing Playbook](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/teaching-responsible-computing-playbook/), covers accessibility, ethics, broadening participation, employment choices, difficult conversations, managing resistance, unintended consequences, and more.

# Fiction

Below are novels and novellas suitable for middle and high school youth:

* [Our Reality](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/OurReality.html) (by Tadayoshi Kohno) is a novella set in 2024 that explores questions of race, surveillance, and augmented reality. It's a great option for middle or high school classrooms that want to examine the intersections of technology, ethics, policy, and race.

* [Power Up!](https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/computer-science-equity-project/student-voice/power-up-graphic-novel/) (by Jean J. Ryoo, Jane Margolis, and Charis JB), is a graphic novel about students taking a stand against how computing is used in their schools.

# Collections

Below are other collections of resources, like this one.

* [Computers and Society](https://computers-society.org). This website, organized by several scholars of computing, ethics, and society, organizes resources for learning and thinking ethically about computing.

* [REAL-CS Student Voices](https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/computer-science-equity-project/student-voice/). This project contains videos, books, and other materials on marginalization in K-12 CS, and including a video that amplifies [student voices in CS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TcjGHS7SdT4).

* [Algorithms and Society YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLD2WeaHwDpXKDc12fiP5ag/videos). This collection of videos discuss issues at the intersection of algorithms and social issues.

# Units, Lessons, and Modules

* [Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1](https://ethicalcs.github.io). This collection by [Evan Peck](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/) at [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu) has several activities that integrate critical consciousness into introductory programming courses.

* [Tech Ethics Syllabi](https://cfiesler.medium.com/tech-ethics-curricula-a-collection-of-syllabi-3eedfb76be18). This collection of course syllabi details the many ways that faculty are teaching ethics in the context of CS education.
