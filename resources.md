We're curating a list of resources for critical CS pedagogy.

# Practice Briefs

We've been developing short 2-page practice briefs that help teachers and school leaders understand opportunities for teaching CS in more critically conscious ways:

* [How to Teach Computer Science as Both a Technical and Social Subject](/assets/documents/TeachingCSTechnicallyAndSocially.pdf) offers opportunities for linking CS to topics in social sciences.

* [Talking about Artificial Intelligence](assets/documents/TalkingAboutArtificialIntelligence.pdf) explains basic concepts in AI and equity, identifying ways to address these concepts in classrooms.

The Mozilla Foundation has also compiled several short practice briefs:

* [Teaching Responsible Computing Playbook](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/teaching-responsible-computing-playbook/), covers accessibility, ethics, broadening participation, employment choices, difficult conversations, managing resistance, unintended consequences, and more.

# Fiction

Below are novels and novellas suitable for middle and high school youth:

* [Our Reality](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/OurReality.html) (by Tadayoshi Kohno) is a novella set in 2024 that explores questions of race, surveillance, and augmented reality. It's a great option for middle or high school classrooms that want to examine the intersections of technology, ethics, policy, and race.

# Collections

Below are other collections of resources, like this one.

* [Computers and Society](https://computers-society.org). This website, organized by several scholars of computing, ethics, and society, organizes resources for learning and thinking ethically about computing.

# Units, Lessons, and Modules

* [Ethical Reflection Modules for CS 1](https://ethicalcs.github.io). This collection by [Evan Peck](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/) at [Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu) has several activities that integrate critical consciousness into introductory programming courses.Fixe
