We're curating a list of resources for critical CS pedagogy.

# Practice Briefs

We've been developing short 2-page practice briefs that help teachers and school leaders understand opportunities for teaching CS in more critically conscious ways:

* [How to Teach Computer Science as Both a Technical and Social Subject](/assets/documents/TeachingCSTechnicallyAndSocially.pdf) offers opportunities for linking CS to topics in social sciences.

* [Talking about Artificial Intelligence](assets/documents/TalkingAboutArtificialIntelligence.pdf) explains basic concepts in AI and equity, identifying ways to address these concepts in classrooms.
