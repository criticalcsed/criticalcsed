We're curating a list of resources for critical CS pedagogy.

# Practice Briefs

We've been developing short 2-page practice briefs that help teachers and school leaders understand opportunities for teaching CS in more critically conscious ways:

* [How to Teach Computer Science as Both a Technical and Social Subject](/assets/documents/TeachingCSTechnicallyAndSocially.pdf) offers opportunities for linking CS to topics in social sciences.

* [Talking about Artificial Intelligence](assets/documents/TalkingAboutArtificialIntelligence.pdf) explains basic concepts in AI and equity, identifying ways to address these concepts in classrooms.

# Fiction

Below are novels and novellas suitable for middle and high school youth:

* [Our Reality|https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~yoshi/OurReality.html] (by Tadayoshi Kohno) is a novella set in 2024 that explores questions of race, surveillance, and augmented reality. It's a great option for middle or high school classrooms that want to examine the intersections of technology, ethics, policy, and race.
